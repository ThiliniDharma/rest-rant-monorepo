# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

### Description

REST-Rant allows users to browse and review restaurants. Users can view a list of places, see details about each place including comments from other users, add new places, edit existing places, and leave comments about their dining experiences.

### Setup

•First, you'll need a Postgres database to connect to. Follow instructions here to setup the database and save credentials for the next step.

•Next create a `.env` file inside of `backend`. It will need to contain the following environment variables (change the values for the database to match what you defined in the previous step)
```
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=rest_rant_user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=rest_rant
```

Next `cd` into `backend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the API.

Next, `cd` into `frontend`, and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the React app.

Finally, in separate terminals, run `npm start` in each folder so that the API and React app are running at the same time.

### Technologies

•Frontend: React
•Backend: Node.js, Express
•Database: PostgreSQL
